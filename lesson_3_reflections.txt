When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Backups
Sharing and collaboration
Working from multiple locations/multiple computers
Manage the volume of commits (vs local data stores)?
Likely possible to integrate continuous integration/testing/deployment?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Someone else might be working on those files
Or you might make some changes locally and there's a risk that they could be over-written by auto updates from the remote

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks - done on GitHub, creates a new branch from someone else's code and gives them credit for it
Clone - copy of a repo
Branch - branch and existing repo ... no real other words to describe this.  Allows development on both branches...
