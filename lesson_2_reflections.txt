What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	This is kicking off a new project
	Need to do this to start a fresh repository into which to place files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area puts files under Git control
	But doesn't commit them yet
	Working directory stuff is not under control, so can be any files
