What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	This is kicking off a new project
	Need to do this to start a fresh repository into which to place files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area puts files under Git control
	But doesn't commit them yet
	Working directory stuff is not under control, so can be any files

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	By adding each file to the staging area once files are updated within the logical change

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	When trying something out
	When implementing a customer-specific fix to a generic product (hotfix)

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Can see what relates to what, where to create a new branch if I want one
	Probably won't ever draw one, but may well use the git log --graph --oneline command to visualise
